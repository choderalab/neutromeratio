Using neural net potentials to calculate energies and nonequilibrium monte carlo to sample tautomeric states.

### Introduction
Accurate calculations of tautomer ratios are hard. Quantum aspects of the proton transfer reaction present a particular theoretical challenge. Most of the published work on tautomer ratio calculations have phenomenological character and closer inspection reveal unjustified assumptions and/or cancelation of errors [1].  

A reliable method for the determination of tautomer ratios would ideally include conformational sampling in explicit water and the calculation of the potential energy with QM level accuracy. These two goals seem reasonable and within reach with the development of neural net potentials like ANI-1 that enable energy calculation with DFT level accuracy and force field like time costs [2]. This enables the exploration of the conformational degrees of freedom while ensuring high level QM energy calculations.

This package contains code to run non-equilibrium candidate monte carlo simulations [3] (NCMC) using the ANI-1 potetnial to calculate work distributions for forward and reverse transformation between a set of tautomers and utilizes bennetâ€™s acceptance ratio (BAR) to estimate the free energy difference between the work distributions.
